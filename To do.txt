 *show tickets for projects that user is already assigned to
 *if user is added to another project, refetch the ticket list corresponding to those projects
 *if there are no possible tickets the user can be assigned, show popup instead of openning
    the ticket dropdown letting the admin know they need to assign the user to a project
 *if user is assigned projects but those projects have no tickets also do the popup thing
 *problem > can only assign tickets to 1 user at a time because the projects they are assigned to
 will be different

 - when selecting ticket, have it be a nested list with the heading of each mini list being the project

>can assign 1 user to a ticket

>give error if user already assigned to project or ticket
